<h2>NBA Size/Scoring Analysis<h2>
  
<b>I wanted to analyze the relationship between a player's size and his scoring ability because I noticed a lot of the best scorers in the league also happened to be some of the biggest players in the league such as LeBron James at 6'8" and 250 and Giannis Antetokounmpo at 6'11" and 242. I wanted to see if this was just confirmation bias or if being bigger really did correlate to scoring more points in the NBA.
